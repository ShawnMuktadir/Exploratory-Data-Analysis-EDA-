Feature Correlation (World Happiness Report)

Project Goal: Perform a comprehensive descriptive analysis on a multi-variate, longitudinal dataset (World Happiness Report, 2008-2018) to identify key drivers and associations of a performance score ('Life Ladder').



Methodology: Conducted data cleaning, addressed missing data imputation strategies, and used correlation analysis to quantify the strength of association between numerous factors (e.g., Gini Index, Log GDP, Freedom) and the target metric.



Outcome: Generated high-impact visualizations and descriptive statistics to identify the strongest potential predictors of the system's outcome, showcasing foundational EDA and data wrangling skills necessary for initial data investigation.
